# CateringScheduling_Problem
Operating Systems Class Project

There is a party 10 guests in my house.I have hired a waiter from a catering company to serve you .we have b√∂rek,cake and drink to be consumed by my 10 guests.(30 boreks,15 slices of cake and 30 glasses of drink)
On the table there are 3 trays for them each has a capacity of 5(5 boreks on borek tray,5 slices of cake on cake tray and 5 glasses of drink on drink tray.)
As the guests eat and drink, a waiter will fill the trays(when there is 0 or 1 left on the tray)
Every guests must eat and drink from all types of food and drink at least once.A guests can eat max 5 boreks and drink 5 glasses of drink ,but can eat only 2 slices of cake.this will until all food and drink is consumed.
Simulate the scheduling by implementing in C,Java or c# showing every step that the guests and waiter do.
